# RaviToken 

This is a solidity program based token which have the syntax and some functionality of the solidity programming language by which we can make our own token named as RaviToken.Credit goes to Metacrafters community as I am a beginner and probably this course is benefit for the beginner also for those who feels to work with the solidity who are new in this field. And how they can good start in this field.  

# Description

The program is about a simple contract to make our own Token which is written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain. This program used as a simple way to start with Solidity programming using different functions in token contract which includes mapping function , mint function and burn function, and can be used as a turning point to achieve your milestone.

# Getting Started

## How Program Executes

First of all to run this program, we can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE which is best for a beginners. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/ and started using it.

Once you reach on the Remix website, create a new file with any name but with the extension ".sol" (e.g., Token.sol) by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar then Save the file.Copy and paste the following code into the file that's what we did to learn somthing:

For compiling the code, we just have to click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. We have to be sure that the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.19" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile RaviToken.sol" button. Hence it compiled.

Once the code is compiled, we can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "RaviToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button. That's what we have do in the Remix it's easy. 

After deploying contract we can choose mint function give some address and provide some input value and click on mint button then check out totalAmount value which will be increases due to mint function then perform the burn function same as we have to provide same address that we gave to mint and provide some input value to it then click burn button to burn the TotalAmount then check totalAmount value which will be burned and decreases , that's how this smart contract token works.
